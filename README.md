Things to do:

Login:
-Javascript Validation Regex expressions for password, email address

Cookie logout:
-We should make the cookie automatically return you to the login page and maybe just say "your session has expired" (and actually log you out)
-Needs to be set up so on next click it logs you out

Registration:
-Validation when user successfully made
-Javascript validation when user does not input location

Homepage:
-Add "Home" button
-Make all buttons links to new pages (not functions)
-Figure out how to make "Log out" a link not a button probably (same for map)

CSS Style Sheet:
-Menu bar

BMW Models page:
-Get rid of BMW Models button
-Have slideshow display at all times

Events: 
-Link to events from database on specific days
-Have events display on "hover" of date
-Provide "Join" button for every event 

Databases:
-Join SQL query to match users and events in user_events database

Posts:
-Put stuff on there... figure out what we want to do
-Maybe have categories for posts etc?
